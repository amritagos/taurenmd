# Installation

The installation of Tauren-MD consists in the configuration of its Python dependencies. We advise use an Anaconda environment dedicated to Tauren-MD, `taurenmd.yml` provides the necessary requirements to created such environment. Run:

```
conda env create -f taurenmd.yml
```

Alternatively, you can use that file as a guide to manually install the required libraries.
