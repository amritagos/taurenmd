# Tauren-MD

An interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics. Designed mostly for users without programming skills, but that serves also those proficient Python programmers.

Tauren-MD wraps around high performance MD analysis libraries, currently: [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj), [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) and [OpenMM](https://github.com/pandegroup/openmm); and other Python libraries to allow simple yet dynamic analysis workflows.

Tauren-MD libraries can be imported and used as such, `import tauren`, or instead, used as a configurable user interface that does not require any programming skills, through the `tauren_config.json` file and `tauren_main.py` main script.
