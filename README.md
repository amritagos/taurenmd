# Tauren-MD

An interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics.  

Tauren-MD wraps around MD analysis libraries such as [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj) or [OpenMM](https://github.com/pandegroup/openmm) and other Python libraries to allow easy and dynamic workflows of analysis.

Tauren-MD libraries can be imported and used as such, `import tauren`, or instead, used as an configurable API that does not require any programming skills, through the `config.json` and `tauren_main.py`.
