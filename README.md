# Tauren-MD

_This is an experimental project under strong development, expect small to drastic changes and updates in its structure, architecture and interfaces._  
_version 0.5.1_

**Tauren-MD is an interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics.**

## Description

Tauren-MD was designed to facilitate the usage MD analysis libraries to non-developer users, but it also serves proficient Pythonistas. 

Tauren-MD wraps around high performance MD analysis libraries, such as: [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj), [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/), [OpenMM](https://github.com/pandegroup/openmm), [ProDy]() and others; and implements additional routines for data representation and export, such as curated plotting templates through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

In this way, Tauren-MD attempts to be an _Ã€ la carte_ menu where the user can easily chose from a predifined list of _actions_ what she/he wants from hers/his trajectories: a configuration file can be easily setup with the desired routines and executed via the `taurenmd` executable file (created after installation).
