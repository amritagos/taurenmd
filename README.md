# Tauren-MD

Simple scripts and libraries to perform parsing and standardized analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations. Scripts may require installation of additional libraries, for example [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj) or [OpenMM](https://github.com/pandegroup/openmm), _it's up to the user to install such libraries._
