# md-tools
Simple scripts to perform parsing of Molecular Dynamics simulations. Scripts may require installation of additional libraries, for example [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj), _it's up to the user to install such libraries._

_I can't deny ;-) the architecture of this repository is inspired in the philosophy of the great [pdb-tools](https://github.com/JoaoRodrigues/pdb-tools)._
