Installation
============

Tauren-MD installation is supported by the `Tree-of-Life project`_,
which was designed with a very specific `vision`_ aimed at non-developer
users. To install a stand-alone Taren-MD, simply:

::

   python install_tauren-md.py

If you are a proficient Python developer/user and wish to manually
setup the required Python environment for Tauren-MD simply use the
`installation/taurenmd.yml` file as guide.
