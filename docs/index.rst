Welcome to Tauren-MD's documentation!
=====================================

Tauren-MD is an interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics (MD).

Tauren-MD was designed to facilitate the usage of scientific MD analysis libraries to non-developer users, though it can be very useful also for the proficient Pythonistas out there. 

Tauren-MD wraps around high performance MD analysis libraries, such as: `MDTraj`_, `OpenMM`_, `ProDy`_ and others; and implements additional routines for data representation and export, such as curated plotting templates through `matplotlib`_.

In this way, Tauren-MD attempts to be an *Ã  la carte* menu where the user can easily chose from a predifined list of _actions_ what she/he wants from hers/his trajectories: a configuration file can be easily setup with the desired routines and executed via the `taurenmd` executable file (created after installation).
