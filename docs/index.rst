Tauren-MD
=========

*version: 0.4.0*

An interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics.

Designed mostly for non-developer users, but that serves also those
proficient Python programmers.

Tauren-MD wraps around high performance MD analysis libraries,
currently: `MDTraj`_ and `OpenMM`_ (`MDAnalysis`_ to be implemented);
and other Python libraries, such as `matplotlib`_, to allow simple yet
dynamic analysis workflows.

Tauren-MD contains sets of predefined functions for *loading*,
*transforming* and *exporting* trajectories, for calculating restraints
from trajectories and also predifined plotting routines to maximize the
output quality. Tauren-MD is an *Ã€ la carte* menu where the user can
easily chose what she/he wants from hers/his trajectories.

Tauren-MD does not require any programming skills to be used, you can
easily configure the ``tauren_config.json`` file with the routines you
wish to execute and run it via ``taurenmd`` executable file (created
after installation).

::

   bin/taurenmd -c your_config.json

You can access further functionalities via:

::

   bin/taurenmd -h

For programmers, Tauren-MD libraries can also be imported and used as
such, ``import tauren``.

Installation
------------

Tauren-MD installation is supported by the `Tree-of-Life project`_,
which was designed with a very specific `vision`_ aimed at non-developer
users. To install a stand-alone Taren-MD, simply:

::

   python install_tauren-md.py

   functionalities are explained, see how easy it is to use it! ``:-)``
