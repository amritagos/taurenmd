   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Tauren-MD's documentation!
=====================================

An interface that streamlines analisis routines for Molecular Dynamics.

Designed mostly for non-developer users, but that serves also those
proficient Python programmers.

Tauren-MD wraps around high performance MD analysis libraries,
currently: `MDTraj`_ and `OpenMM`_ (`MDAnalysis`_ to be implemented);
and other Python libraries, such as `matplotlib`_, to allow simple yet
dynamic analysis workflows.

Tauren-MD contains sets of predefined functions for *loading*,
*transforming* and *exporting* trajectories, for calculating restraints
from trajectories and also predifined plotting routines to maximize the
output quality. Tauren-MD is an *Ã€ la carte* menu where the user can
easily chose what she/he wants from hers/his trajectories.

Tauren-MD does not require any programming skills to be used, you can
easily configure the ``tauren_config.json`` file with the routines you
wish to execute and run it via ``taurenmd`` executable file (created
after installation).
